- If there are no control flow statements, the assertion flow analysis has trouble breaking down falsely large clone set.
- Single or few assertions with no control flow statements is likely to produce false positive.
- Test methods with fewer number of assertions and no control flow statments can still be matched because of lack of control flow statements (StoerWagnerMinimumCutTest).
